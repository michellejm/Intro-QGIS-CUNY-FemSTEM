# FemSTEM Hack Day - Data 

### NYC Open Data

The data for our Hack came from NYC Open Data. 
* In a web browser (i.e., Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari) navigate to [www.opendata.cityofnewyork.us](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). 

#### Census Tracts

* In the Search Bar, type 'census tracts'. 
* Select the `2010 Census Tracts` [link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2010-Census-Tracts/fxpq-c8ku)

* **Click** on the `Export` button, then Download as: `Shapefile`

This will download as a zip file (probably in your Downloads Folder). Unzip the folder and move the contents to the FemSTEM/Data/Shape folder that you downloaded when you downloaded the Git Repository for this Hack. 

The name will be a download code from NYC Open Data. Feel free to change this by right clicking on each file and selecting 'rename'.
