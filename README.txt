Introduction to mapping with QGIS

This hack will introduce the fundamentals of map making with open source mapping software, QGIS. The map on your phone does a great job of helping you find places, but GIS (geographic information systems) allows you to make your own maps for display and ask spatial questions for research. By participating in this hack, you will learn how to make a map using publicly available data and how to ask and answer spatial questions. 

By going through the process of map making from data collection to display, you will learn:
-what kinds of data are necessary for map making
-how to join datasets together
-how to visualize different types of data
-what projections are and why they matter
-how to work with historic maps.

Though participants do not need any prior knowledge to participate in this hack, you must have access to a computer with administrator privileges to install QGIS.
